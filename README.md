# CS5340-DDoS-Attack-Detection
Project for CS5340 Uncertainty Modeling in AI

Raw Data is always a bit tricky to read, but it won't be if I extract the data I need from it. So I only used processed Data instead of Raw Data in this project.


The data in the project comes from a simulated DDoS attack. We obtained first-hand information about DDoS by attacking the range (a Debian Server) and collecting data.
